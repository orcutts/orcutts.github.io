				<h3>Adopt older chicken</h3>
				<p>There are two kinds of adoption that take place in the chicken world.  They are accepting an older chicken into an existing flock, and having an older chicken who is in broody accept a baby chick as her baby.  We did both of these adoption types with success.  Shirley is a frizzle bantam - with beautiful browns and oranges and black feathers, which means that she is tiny and has wacky feathers pointing in all directions.  When we adopted her we were told that she was older and had mostly stopped laying eggs.  We rescued her from a farm that raised turkeys, and poor shirley had been pecked nearly to death by them.  It took several week of isolation to get her to trust us, and then we began introducing her to Ruby and Martha (our flock at the time).  By putting her in a separate enclosure when the flock was free ranging- it let them see each other and start communicating and doing their chicken talk.  There were a few scuffles when we finally introduced her to the flock.  For the next two weeks we would let all three chickens roam around together while we either worked in the garden or watched.  That way we could separate them if necessary.  Shirley is thriving, even years later, and probably our most resilient egg layer, even if the eggs are about 1/3 of the size of the bigger chicken's eggs.  While she is considered an old lady in bantam chicken years, she is one of our favorites.  The frizzle bantam breed also has a high rate of going broody.  That is when the chicken will sit on the eggs and not come out of the coop for food and water unless it is necessary.  They want a baby chicken bad.  So we decided to try her out with a baby chick.  We knew it would either be a success or else she would try to attack the baby.
				</p>
				<h3>Adopt baby chic</h3>
				<p>That's when we purchased Daisy- a white easter egger with sage green eggs.  We kept daisy inside for only a few hours to make sure she was comfortable and fed, and then took her out to the broody Shirley in the coop.  It was a very tense moment when we sat the baby chick right in front of Shirley as she sat in the coop.  They stared at each other for porbably 15 min solid- neither really moving very much.  When finally shirley let out a soft low cluckle, lifted her wing, and daisy climbed right underneath.  She was an amazing chicken mamma.  She kept the bigger chickens away from the baby, taught the baby how to eat and drink from the food bowls, taught daisy to hunt and scratch and take a sunbath.  It was a very cool experience to watch over the course of about 4 months.  When daisy was big enough, shirley would walk further away and let the bigger girls pick on daisy.  Only a little bit, only enough to teach her about the pecking order and how to defend herself and then back down.  The irony is that once daisy was a full grown adult, she mercilessly picked on shirley for months until she ascending to second highest in the pecking order.  Today they still cuddle together at night and sometimes will still take dust baths together.
