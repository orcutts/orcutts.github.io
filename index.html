				<h3>About Us</h3>
				<p>Hello, and welcome to our family's page for backyard chickens.  During the weekday we wear the hats of engineer and chef instructor.  But on the weekends we are chicken loving, garden gurus and yard work warriors.  We currently reside in Richland, Washington and have five hens in our flock.  We love our chickens - they have definitely become part of our family and have provided hours of entertainment and cuddles (Yes, chickens cuddle).  Initially, back yard chickening was meant to be an experiment with a small coop and two chickens in the corner of our garden.  Our coop area now consists of a 5x15 coop and a 20x20 fenced in run, and takes up a third of our garden.  In the evenings and on weekends, our chickens enjoy free ranging in the back yard and garden.  We initially tried to keep them out of the garden because they will eat most vegetable starts 
				</p>

				<p>This page is meant to be a reference tool for beginners.  The above menu items will link to our experiences with the different ways of selecting chickens and starting a flock (starting with buying baby chicks, adopting chickens into the flock (both as adults and as babies), as well as our experience with incubating eggs.) Below is information about some of the different chicken breeds, the basics of egg colorings, links to local ordinances and online groups, as well as the basics of setting up your own back yard coop structure.  We hope you enjoy what we have to share with you.  Thanks for checking us out.

					<h3>About that egg color...</h3>
					<div class="scroll-bar">
					<p>Egg colors vary by breed and can range from bright blues to dark browns (sometimes reddish) to sage greens to whites or tans... or anywhere in between. If you are building your flock to achieve a certain color of egg, you'll want to do some research into what breeds generate the different colors.  Something that we have enjoyed is trying to create our natural "easter basket".  As you can see from the image below, we are pretty close.  
					</p>

				</br>
				<p>Another thing to note beyond the color of the egg, is the shade of color.  If you were to type "Chicken egg colors" into a browser, you will see that there are many shades of each color.  It is quite a sport to breed certain colors.  We just took our chickens for what their breed likely laid and hoped for the best.  Even if you were to breed your perfect color of egg, you can see from the image below that the egg color throughout the lifecycle of the chicken can change.  In this case, it was the beginning changes as a chicken began to lay.  This is called "getting her paint on".  Additionally, the eggs may become lighter or more speckled with time.
