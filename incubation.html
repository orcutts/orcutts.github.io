				<h3>Introduction</h3>
				<p>There is a lot of information about incubating eggs on the internet.  Sometimes the elementary teachers will set up an incubation unit in their class rooms to teach the kids about the process.  There are also people who make a decent profit doing large scale incubation and sale of chickens for meat.  Before you start looking up information on the interwebs, it will greatly improve your browser searches if you first decide what type of chickens you want to incubate, what size of production operation you want to have, and what your plan will be for extra chickens you may/may not have.  Also keep in mind that you will have a 50:50 chance of getting a male vs female, and most urban areas do not allow roosters due to noise. Additionally, keep in mind that some of the eggs you try to incubate will never hatch and also that some of the chicks that do hatch will die within the first two days.
				</p>
				<h3>Picking Your Eggs</h3>
				<p>With the incubation process you have great flexibility to pick our whatever kind of chicken you want, as well as get a pretty good idea of what the feather color and egg color will be.  We wanted to have some really dark chocolate eggs so we ordered online some black copper maran eggs.  This breed is one of the show dogs of the chicken world.  People will intentionally pair a rooster with quality markings and geneology (yes, they keep track of lineage on this one) and a distant cousin that may have a slightly lower quality inorder to get a desired egg effect or feather color pattern. Because of that, some of the eggs can be quite expensive, comparatively.  So do your research and know what you want to get and what you want to pay.
				</p>  
				<h3>Buying Equipment</h3>
				<p>The most important components to any incubation system are temperature, humidity, and egg rotation.  The window for temperature range is extremely small.  The target is 99.5 degree F, +/- 1 degree.  The system you choose should be able to maintain that constant temperature.  The humidity is a little more flexible, but needs to be adjustable.  During the first few weeks of incubation the temperature should be kept between 40-50 percent.  During the final weeks that should be raised to 65-75 percent.  The first system we chose was an all-in-one that had a capacity of 4-5 eggs.  While this would be an affordable and easy option for starting out, my wife got a little carried away in her online egg ordering.  So we opted for a larger unit that could accomodate 8 dozen eggs and had two auto-rotating racks.  We bought a separate hydrometer online as well.
				</p> 
				<h3>Picking the Keepers</h3>
				<p>Freshly hatched baby chickens are NOT cute.  But once they have had a day to dry out and fluff out their fuzz, they are super adorable and sweet.  If you incubate extra eggs to offset the possibility of males and/or early death- then you will have the difficult choice of which of these adorable little creatures to keep and which to give away/sell.  Over the first two weeks - watch your chickens for personality traits:  are they shy, aggressive, do they like to be cuddled, are they good eaters, etc.  We used removable leg ties to identify our favorites, and then each week removed a set number from our favorites.  In the end, we hatched 23 chicks and ended up keeping 5 hens and one roo.  I said earlier that roosters inside city limits are illegal.  However, you can keep all chickens up to 6 months.  That means that you can keep roosters, or 30 chicks, or whatever you want up until the rooster starts crowing or until the chickens are too big and too many for the coop.  Roosters help the hens during development.  They have an inate reaction to protect, lead, and feed the hens.  So that is why we kept our one roo as long as we could.  In the end, we kept two of black copper marans , thereby completing our limit of 5 "household pets".
