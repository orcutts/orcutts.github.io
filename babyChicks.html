				<p>Baby chicks are available ifor purchase in most feed stores, beginning in April and running through August.  They are also advertised for sale in farming groups, in online group sites (like backyardchickens.com), and in several other forums.  There are three things that you should keep in mind when starting your flock.  These are: the time of year, the desired breed, and your local ordinances regarding number of chickens (pets) and whether or not roosters are allowed.  Most chickens will require isolation from cold/wet elements and the rest of the flock for up to three months.  For Eastern Washington, the best time of the year to purchase baby chicks falls in the late march - early may window of time.  If looking for a specific breed you may have to look around online.  Most of the feed stores here sell the Easter Eggers - the mutts of the chicken world.  When buying chicks- remember that you won't be able to identify the sex of the chicken until it is 4-6 weeks old (sometimes sooner, sometimes longer).  It is always easier to give away any roosters you may end up with than to go and try to find more chicks with a later development cycle.
				</p>

				<p>We purchased two chicks as the starts to our flock in early may - Ruby and Martha.  We kept the two babies in a 2 ft deep rubbermade tote inside with a heat lamp on them.  As they grew and starting jumping out of the tub/flying across the living room, we were forced to get some bird netting to keep over the top.  When they began to develop feathers, we would take them outside on warm days and let them scratch around on the grass under supervision, but would always bring them back into the tub/heat lamp.  If you do want your chickens to be cuddlers, I recommend starting to handle them and pet them around the same time.  When their feathers start growing in it itches, and ours loved back rubs/scratches to alleviate some of the discomfort.  This is also a good time to start introducing small treats for your chickens. We opted to stick primarily with the healthy treats (yogurt, string cheese, watermelon, seeds, berries, and apple cores) over mealworms or other feed store products.
